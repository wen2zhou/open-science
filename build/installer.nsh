# Resilient replacement for handleUninstallResult's default failure handling, installed via
# electron-builder's customUnInstallCheck hooks below. During an in-app update the new installer
# runs the OLD uninstaller and treats any non-zero exit code as fatal ("Failed to uninstall old
# application files. Please try running the installer again.: <code>") — aborting the update.
# That code is not trustworthy for our assisted installer (oneClick: false): electron-builder only
# normalizes the uninstaller's exit code (quitSuccess, "avoid exit code 2") for ONE_CLICK builds,
# so a benign trailing error leaks out as exit code 2 even when the old version was fully removed
# (electron-userland/electron-builder#9593). And when the code IS real, it is usually a background
# child still running from the install dir (micromamba provisioning, the CLI in Node mode, an
# agent child) locking files — worth one more attempt after a force-kill instead of failing.
# Recovery order (${DIR} = the installation this pass was uninstalling):
#   1. Exit code non-zero but the old executable is already gone -> the uninstall did its job
#      despite the reported code; log and continue installing.
#   2. Files remain -> force-kill processes running from the install dir, wait, and run the old
#      uninstaller once more. Only if it still fails show the original dialog and quit.
# Symbol constraints: handleUninstallResult is parsed BEFORE uninstallOldVersion and
# CHECK_APP_RUNNING declare their globals ($installationDir, $PowerShellPath, ...), and makensis
# treats unknown variables as errors — so this stays self-contained: registers, built-in
# constants, and the literal temp-uninstaller path uninstallOldVersion uses.
