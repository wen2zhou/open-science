This skill covers remote compute over SSH: listing hosts, creating handles, running short
remote commands (callCommand), reading/writing host knowledge docs, and the full async
job lifecycle — submit → harvest → analysis turn → publish artifacts.

**Where host.compute runs:** `host.compute` lives ONLY on the control-plane REPL kernel — run
every example below with the `repl_execute` tool (JavaScript), the same kernel that hosts
`host.mcp`. The `python`/`r` data kernels have NO `host.compute` (SSH and approvals stay outside
the sandbox workspace); calling it from a python/r cell will fail with `host.compute is undefined`.

## Registered hosts

<!-- open-science:compute-hosts:start -->

Run `await host.compute.list()` to see all registered hosts.
<!-- open-science:compute-hosts:end -->

Each host entry shows:

- Display name
- Provider ID (e.g., `ssh:biowulf`, `ssh:192.168.1.100`)
- Shape (e.g., `direct_ssh`, `slurm`, `pbs`)
- Connection status

## Session-active host

The user may enable one host for this conversation via the `≡` panel in the composer.
Always check which host is active before creating a handle:

```javascript
// Returns the session-enabled host provider_ids (a string[] subset of all registered hosts).
// Empty array means the user hasn't chosen a host for this conversation yet.
const activeHosts = await host.compute.listCompute()
const c = activeHosts[0] ? host.compute.create(activeHosts[0]) : null
```

## API reference

```javascript
// List ALL registered hosts
const hosts = await host.compute.list()

// List session-enabled hosts (user's active selection for this conversation)
const activeHosts = await host.compute.listCompute()

// Create a handle to a specific host (no network call)
const c = host.compute.create('ssh:<alias>')

// Run a short remote command (throws on approval_denied / host_unreachable / timeout)
const result = await c.callCommand('<shell command>', '<one-line intent for the approval card>', {
  loginShell: true, // default: true — runs login profiles, then readable ~/.bashrc, before this command
  timeoutSeconds: 60 // optional — the host applies its own default (60s) when omitted
})
// result → { exit_code, stdout, stderr, truncated }

// Read the host knowledge doc (returns { doc, isSkeleton })
const info = await host.compute.details('ssh:<alias>', { mode: 'read' })

// Append a note to the host knowledge doc (agent writes; 32 KB cap enforced)
await host.compute.details('ssh:<alias>', {
  mode: 'append',
  text: '\n## Note\nlearned X on <date>'
})

// Replace the entire host knowledge doc (oldText must match the current doc exactly)
await host.compute.details('ssh:<alias>', {
  mode: 'replace',
  text: '<new full doc>',
  oldText: info.doc // from the read above
})
```

With `loginShell: true`, the remote Bash login profiles run first and then Open Science attempts to
source `~/.bashrc` when it is readable. A `.bashrc` can deliberately return early for non-interactive
shells, so variables declared after such a guard are not available. A missing `.bashrc` is a no-op.
Set `loginShell: false` to run the command without either initialization step. Initialization failures
are reported through the normal command result/error behavior.

## API reference (async jobs)

Use `submitJob` for long-running computations (minutes to hours). It returns immediately with a
`job_id`; the job runs on the remote host in the background. When the job finishes, the app
automatically harvests the outputs and initiates a new analysis turn — **you never poll or block**.

```javascript
// List the session's active compute hosts (set via the ≡ host selector)
const activeHosts = await host.compute.listCompute()
// returns ['ssh:<alias>', ...] — the provider_ids currently enabled for this session

// Submit a non-blocking job — returns immediately after the user approves
const c = host.compute.create('ssh:<alias>')
const job = await c.submitJob(
  '<one-line intent for the approval card>', // shown in the approval card
  '<shell command>', // command to run remotely
  {
    timeoutSeconds: 3600, // optional; default 24 h, max 7 days
    inputs: [
      { src: 'in.dat', dstFilename: 'in.dat' }, // stage a workspace file
      { remotePath: 'ssh:<alias>/<abs_path>' } // link a remote file (no transfer)
    ],
    outputs: [
      '*.result', // featured (default visibility)
      { glob: '*.json', visibility: 'featured' }, // explicitly featured
      { glob: '*.log', visibility: 'hidden' }, // hidden (diagnostic, not shown in card)
      { glob: 'checkpoints/**', residency: 'remote' } // leave on remote — recorded in left_on_remote
    ],
    harvest: {
      exclude: ['work/**'], // never harvest these paths
      maxFileMb: 100, // single-file hard maximum (100 MiB)
      maxTotalMb: 500 // per-job hard maximum, including stdout/stderr (500 MiB)
    }
  }
)
// job → { job_id, provider_id, status: 'submitted', remote_workdir }
print(job.job_id) // end the cell — kernel never blocks on compute
```

**End the cell here. Do NOT write a polling loop.** The app runs the poller and harvest in the
background. When the job finishes, the app automatically starts a new analysis turn in this
conversation — the conversation is NOT locked while the job runs, so the user can keep chatting.

### Harvest safety boundaries

- Declared output files are selected before `stdout` and `stderr`; logs use the remaining per-job budget.
- The app rejects model-supplied limits above 100 MiB per file or 500 MiB per job.
- Harvest also preserves a fixed 2 GiB of free local disk space. Files that do not fit remain remote.

### Behavior boundaries

- **While the job runs:** the conversation is open. The user can send messages; you can handle
  other tasks. No blocking wait.
- **When the job finishes:** the app initiates a new analysis turn automatically. You do not
  trigger this — it happens without any action on your part.
- **Do NOT write** a loop calling `attachJob().status()` to wait for completion. That is the
  app's job, not yours. Writing such a loop would block the conversation for the entire job
  duration.

### Check job status (non-blocking read, for informational use)

```javascript
// Non-blocking DB read — no SSH. Use if you need a status snapshot mid-conversation.
const handle = c.attachJob(job.job_id)
const s = await handle.status()
// s → { job_id, status, exit_code, stdout_tail, stderr_tail, remote_workdir }
// status: 'submitted' | 'running' | 'success' | 'failed' | 'timeout' | 'error'
```

### submitJob status values

| status      | meaning                                                                |
| ----------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `submitted` | accepted; background dispatch in progress                              |
| `running`   | remote process confirmed alive (pid recorded)                          |
| `success`   | exit code 0                                                            |
| `failed`    | non-zero exit (`job_failed`) or process vanished (`process_vanished`)  |
| `timeout`   | exceeded `timeoutSeconds`                                              |
| `error`     | never reached the remote host (`host_unreachable` / `dispatch_failed`) |

## Workflow: the analysis turn

When the app initiates the analysis turn, it provides the `job_id`, `status`, and harvested paths.
Prefer `local_featured_files`: these are absolute paths on the machine running Open Science and are
directly readable across the control REPL, Python/R Notebook kernels, and the agent shell. For
compatibility, older notifications may only provide workspace-relative `featured_files` under
`hpc/<job_id>/`; do not prepend the Notebook kernel's `data/` cwd to those paths. In this turn:

1. Call `attachJob(job_id).result()` to get the full result dict.
2. Inspect the outputs, run any analysis needed.
3. Call `write_artifact_file` to publish outputs worth keeping as artifacts.

```javascript
// In the analysis turn — read the full harvested result (non-blocking DB + directory scan)
const c = host.compute.create('ssh:<alias>')
const r = await c.attachJob(job_id).result()
// r → {
//   job_id, status, exit_code,
//   featured_files: ['hpc/<job_id>/featured/out.result', ...],   // compatibility: workspace-relative
//   hidden_files:   ['hpc/<job_id>/hidden/run.log', ...],
//   output_files:   [...featured_files, ...hidden_files],         // featured first
//   localFeaturedFiles: ['/absolute/local/.../hpc/<job_id>/featured/out.result', ...],
//   left_on_remote: [{ uri: 'ssh:<alias>/<abs_path>', size_mb: 420, reason: 'residency:remote' }],
//   remote_workdir: '.openscience/jobs/<job_id>',
//   stdout_tail: '...last 64 KB...',
//   stderr_tail: '...last 64 KB...'
// }
```

Use `localFeaturedFiles` when present. It contains paths on the local Open Science machine, not
paths on the remote Compute Host. Fall back to `featured_files` only for compatibility with older
app versions; resolve those workspace-relative paths from the Session workspace rather than the
Notebook kernel's `data/` cwd:

```python
# Python cell — pass a localFeaturedFiles entry from the result
import pandas as pd
df = pd.read_csv('/absolute/.../hpc/<job_id>/featured/results.csv')
```

### Publish artifacts

Harvest only lands files in the workspace — it does NOT publish artifacts automatically.
Call `write_artifact_file` in the analysis turn to publish outputs worth keeping:

```javascript
// In the analysis turn — publish featured outputs as artifacts (bound to this turn)
for (const path of r.localFeaturedFiles ?? r.featured_files) {
  await host.mcp('artifacts', 'write_artifact_file', { path })
}
// Artifacts appear in the artifact panel with provenance tied to this analysis turn.
```

### When the job fails

Read `r.exit_code` and `r.stderr_tail`. An infrastructure failure (wrong partition, env not
activated, missing module, OOM, walltime) is yours to fix — adjust `command`, record the fix,
fresh `c.submitJob()`. A harvest failure (`r.stderr_tail` notes it, `r.remote_workdir` is
preserved) means some files were not downloaded — the remote workdir is kept so you can
`c.callCommand('ls ...', intent='...')` to inspect what's there.

## Chaining jobs via left_on_remote

Large outputs declared with `residency: 'remote'` or files that exceed the size threshold stay
on the remote host and appear in `r.left_on_remote`. Use their URIs directly as `remotePath`
inputs to the next job — no local round-trip:

```javascript
// In the analysis turn — chain a left_on_remote output into the next job
const big_output_uri = r.left_on_remote[0].uri // e.g. 'ssh:biowulf//scratch/jobs/<id>/big.h5'

const job2 = await c.submitJob(
  'process big.h5 output from job 1',
  'python process.py --input big.h5 --out summary.csv',
  {
    inputs: [
      { remotePath: big_output_uri } // symlinked in job workdir, no transfer
    ],
    outputs: ['summary.csv']
  }
)
```

## Submitting several jobs

Submit a batch and let each job's analysis turn handle its results independently. The app
triggers a separate analysis turn for each job as it finishes (or merges simultaneous
completions into one turn with multiple job_ids):

```javascript
// Submit multiple jobs — end the cell after all submits
const c = host.compute.create('ssh:gpu-cluster')
const jobs = []
for (const seed of [0, 1, 2, 3, 4]) {
  const job = await c.submitJob(
    `AlphaFold seed ${seed}`,
    `python fold.py --seed ${seed} --in input.fasta --out ranked.pdb`,
    {
      inputs: [{ src: 'input.fasta', dstFilename: 'input.fasta' }],
      outputs: [{ glob: '*.pdb', visibility: 'featured' }],
      timeoutSeconds: 3600
    }
  )
  jobs.push(job.job_id)
}
print(jobs) // end the cell — no waiting, no loop
```

The app triggers one analysis turn per job completion (or a merged turn for simultaneous
completions). **Do NOT write a loop collecting all results** — each analysis turn handles
its job independently.

## Session concurrency control

Cap how many non-terminal jobs run at once across all providers in this conversation. Jobs that
would exceed the cap enter a `queued` state and auto-dispatch when a slot frees up. These two
methods live on the handle returned by `create()`, but they are **session-scoped** — they act on
the whole conversation, not on the handle's bound provider.

```javascript
const c = host.compute.create('ssh:<alias>')

// Set the conversation-wide limit (positive integer 1..500).
await c.setConcurrencyLimit(2)

// Read the session's concurrency status (non-blocking DB read, no SSH).
const s = await c.status()
// s → {
//   session_limit: number | null,            // the cap you set, or null if unset
//   active_count: number,                    // non-terminal jobs running now
//   queued_count: number,                    // jobs waiting for a slot
//   provider_ceilings: Record<string, number> // per-host hard limits (host config)
// }
```

## callCommand error handling

```javascript
try {
  const r = await c.callCommand('cmd', '<intent>')
} catch (e) {
  const code = e.error_code || ''
  if (code === 'host_unreachable') {
    // SSH connectivity issue — needs user action (VPN, key, etc.); e.retry_after_user_action is true
  } else if (code === 'approval_denied') {
    // User declined the approval card
  } else if (code === 'timeout') {
    // Command exceeded timeoutSeconds
  }
}
```

## Typical first-contact workflow

1. `await host.compute.details(provider_id, { mode: 'read' })` — a `## Resources` skeleton means
   first contact; populated sections mean prior sessions did the legwork, trust them.
2. Bind once: `const c = host.compute.create(provider_id)`.
3. Run one batched probe: `await c.callCommand('id; module avail 2>&1 | head -40', '<intent>')`.
4. Append what you learned via `await host.compute.details(..., { mode: 'append' })`.

## What to record in the knowledge doc

The knowledge doc is the only state that survives across sessions. Record:

- Scheduler type and any known partition/account combinations that worked.
- Environment activation commands (e.g. `module load X/<ver>`, `conda activate <env>`).
- Verified invocations tagged `verified <date>`; user-provided info tagged `per user <date>`.
- Gotchas specific to this host or provider.

Do NOT record per-job state, transient errors, or facts about your project — those belong
elsewhere. When a session ends without new host-specific learnings, write nothing.
