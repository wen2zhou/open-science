This skill covers remote compute over SSH: listing hosts, creating handles, running short
remote commands (call_command), reading/writing host knowledge docs, and the full async
job lifecycle — submit → harvest → analysis turn → publish artifacts.

**V1 execution backends (what can actually run jobs):** Open Science V1 can EXECUTE jobs via
**Direct SSH** and **Slurm**. The probe may DETECT PBS or LSF on a host, but those are not executable
backends in this release — submitting a job to a PBS/LSF-detected host fails fast with a clear message
asking the user to select Direct SSH. Do not promise a user that a PBS/LSF job will run. See
`docs/compute-release-checklist.md` for the production-ready boundary per release.

**Where host.compute runs:** `host.compute` lives ONLY on the control-plane REPL kernel — run
every example below with the `repl_execute` tool (JavaScript), the same kernel that hosts
`host.mcp`. The `python`/`r` data kernels have NO `host.compute` (SSH and approvals stay outside
the sandbox workspace); calling it from a python/r cell will fail with `host.compute is undefined`.

## Registered hosts

Run `await host.compute.list()` to see all registered hosts.

Each host entry shows:
- Display name
- Provider ID (e.g., `ssh:biowulf`, `ssh:192.168.1.100`)
- Shape (e.g., `direct_ssh`, `slurm`, `pbs`)
- Connection status

## Session-active host

The user may enable one host for this conversation via the `≡` panel in the composer.
Always check which host is active before creating a handle:

```javascript
// Returns the session-enabled host provider_ids (a string[] subset of all registered hosts).
// Empty array means the user hasn't chosen a host for this conversation yet.
const activeHosts = await host.compute.list_compute()
const c = activeHosts[0] ? host.compute.create(activeHosts[0]) : null
```

## API reference

```javascript
// List ALL registered hosts
const hosts = await host.compute.list()

// List session-enabled hosts (user's active selection for this conversation)
const activeHosts = await host.compute.list_compute()

// Create a handle to a specific host (no network call)
const c = host.compute.create('ssh:<alias>')

// Run a short remote command (throws on approval_denied / host_unreachable / timeout)
const result = await c.call_command('<shell command>', '<one-line intent for the approval card>', {
  login_shell: true,   // default: true — loads the login shell so module/conda PATH is visible
  timeout_seconds: 60  // optional — the host applies its own default (60s) when omitted
})
// result → { exit_code, stdout, stderr, truncated }

// Read the host knowledge doc (returns { doc, isSkeleton })
const info = await host.compute.details('ssh:<alias>', { mode: 'read' })

// Append a note to the host knowledge doc (agent writes; 32 KB cap enforced)
await host.compute.details('ssh:<alias>', { mode: 'append', text: '\n## Note\nlearned X on <date>' })

// Replace the entire host knowledge doc (old_text must match the current doc exactly)
await host.compute.details('ssh:<alias>', {
  mode: 'replace',
  text: '<new full doc>',
  old_text: info.doc   // from the read above
})
```

## API reference (async jobs)

Use `submit_job` for long-running computations (minutes to hours). It returns immediately with a
`job_id`; the job runs on the remote host in the background. When the job finishes, the app
automatically harvests the outputs and initiates a new analysis turn — **you never poll or block**.

```javascript
// List the session's active compute hosts (set via the ≡ host selector)
const activeHosts = await host.compute.list_compute()
// returns ['ssh:<alias>', ...] — the provider_ids currently enabled for this session

// Submit a non-blocking job — returns immediately after the user approves
const c = host.compute.create('ssh:<alias>')
const job = await c.submit_job(
  '<one-line intent for the approval card>',  // shown in the approval card
  '<shell command>',                           // the WORKLOAD itself — never an sbatch/salloc call
  {
    timeout_seconds: 3600,  // optional; default 24 h, max 7 days
    resources: {            // optional — scheduler resources; see "Requesting resources" below
      partition: 'debug',
      cpusPerTask: 1,
      memoryMib: 500,
      timeLimitSeconds: 300
    },
    inputs: [
      { src: 'in.dat', dst_filename: 'in.dat' },          // stage a workspace file
      { remote_path: 'ssh:<alias>/<abs_path>' }            // link a remote file (no transfer)
    ],
    outputs: [
      '*.result',                                           // featured (default visibility)
      { glob: '*.json', visibility: 'featured' },          // explicitly featured
      { glob: '*.log',  visibility: 'hidden' },            // hidden (diagnostic, not shown in card)
      { glob: 'checkpoints/**', residency: 'remote' }      // leave on remote — recorded in left_on_remote
    ],
    harvest: {
      exclude: ['work/**'],      // never harvest these paths
      max_file_mb: 100,          // single-file cap (default 100 MB)
      max_total_mb: 500          // total-harvest cap (default 500 MB)
    }
  }
)
// job → { job_id, provider_id, status: 'submitted', remote_workdir }
print(job.job_id)   // end the cell — kernel never blocks on compute
```

**End the cell here. Do NOT write a polling loop.** The app runs the poller and harvest in the
background. When the job finishes, the app automatically starts a new analysis turn in this
conversation — the conversation is NOT locked while the job runs, so the user can keep chatting.

### Requesting resources — never write `sbatch` yourself

**On a Slurm host, `submit_job` already wraps your command in an `#SBATCH` script and submits it.**
Pass the workload as `command` and request resources through the structured `resources` option. A
`command` that calls `sbatch` or `salloc` itself is **rejected at submit** with
`invalid_directives` — it would create a second, untracked job (see below).

| field | type | maps to |
|-------|------|---------|
| `partition` | string | `--partition` |
| `account` | string | `--account` |
| `qos` | string | `--qos` |
| `nodes` | int | `--nodes` |
| `tasks` | int | `--ntasks` |
| `cpusPerTask` | int | `--cpus-per-task` |
| `memoryMib` | int (MiB) | `--mem` |
| `gpus` | int | `--gres=gpu:N` |
| `gpuType` | string | `--gres=gpu:<type>:N` |
| `timeLimitSeconds` | int (≤ 7 d) | `--time` |

Unknown fields are rejected, so a typo surfaces as an error instead of being silently dropped.

```javascript
// CORRECT — the workload is the command; the scheduler flags are structured
await c.submit_job('prime sieve to 5e6', 'python3 sieve.py 5000000', {
  resources: { partition: 'debug', cpusPerTask: 1, memoryMib: 500, timeLimitSeconds: 300 },
  outputs: ['primes.txt']
})

// WRONG — rejected: this submits a second job the app cannot see
await c.submit_job('prime sieve', 'sbatch -c 1 --mem=500M --wrap "python3 sieve.py"')
```

Why nesting is refused rather than merely discouraged: the job the app holds a handle for would be
the *wrapper*, which exits the moment `sbatch` returns. Its status would report the submission, not
your work; harvest would run against outputs that do not exist yet; and cancelling would kill the
wrapper while the real job kept running. Self-submitting workflow managers (Nextflow / Snakemake
Slurm executors) are refused for the same reason — a V1 limitation.

**`srun` is fine** — it launches a step inside the allocation the wrapper already holds.

**To request N jobs that actually run concurrently, set `memoryMib`.** Many clusters default an
unspecified `--mem` to the node's entire memory, so N jobs each implicitly claim the whole node and
the scheduler runs them one at a time. If jobs sit at `submitted` longer than expected, read
`queue_reason` from `status()` — `Resources` or `Priority` there is the tell.

**Multi-line scripts:** stage the script as an input instead of packing it into one shell line —
`inputs: [{ src: 'run.py', dst_filename: 'run.py' }]` with `command: 'python3 run.py'`.

### Behavior boundaries

- **While the job runs:** the conversation is open. The user can send messages; you can handle
  other tasks. No blocking wait.
- **When the job finishes:** the app initiates a new analysis turn automatically. You do not
  trigger this — it happens without any action on your part.
- **Do NOT write** a loop calling `attach_job().status()` to wait for completion. That is the
  app's job, not yours. Writing such a loop would block the conversation for the entire job
  duration.

### Check job status (non-blocking read, for informational use)

```javascript
// Non-blocking DB read — no SSH. Use if you need a status snapshot mid-conversation.
const handle = c.attach_job(job.job_id)
const s = await handle.status()
// s → { job_id, status, exit_code, stdout_tail, stderr_tail, remote_workdir,
//       remote_state, queue_reason }
// status: 'submitted' | 'running' | 'success' | 'failed' | 'timeout' | 'error'
// remote_state: scheduler-native state (Slurm: PENDING/RUNNING/COMPLETED/TIMEOUT/OUT_OF_MEMORY/...)
// queue_reason: why a pending job is not running yet (Slurm: Resources, Priority, QOSMaxJobs, ...)
```

On a Slurm host, `status` is the app's own lifecycle and `remote_state` is what the scheduler says.
A job stuck at `submitted` with `queue_reason: 'Resources'` is queued, not broken — check whether
`memoryMib` is set (see "Requesting resources"). `status` reflects **your** job, so if it reports
terminal while you believe work is still running on the cluster, the command submitted something the
app is not tracking.

### submit_job status values

| status | meaning |
|--------|---------|
| `submitted` | accepted; background dispatch in progress |
| `running` | remote process confirmed alive (pid recorded) |
| `success` | exit code 0 |
| `failed` | non-zero exit (`job_failed`) or process vanished (`process_vanished`) |
| `timeout` | exceeded `timeout_seconds` |
| `error` | never reached the remote host (`host_unreachable` / `dispatch_failed` / `invalid_directives`) |

`invalid_directives` means the script was refused before any SSH: a reserved `#SBATCH` directive
(`--job-name`, `--output`, `--error`, `--chdir`, `--array`, `--wrap`, `--wait` — the runner owns
these), a directive that duplicates a structured `resources` field, or a nested `sbatch`/`salloc`.
Read `stderr_tail` for which one, fix the command, resubmit.

## Workflow: the analysis turn

When the app initiates the analysis turn, it provides the `job_id`, `status`, and
`featured_files` (workspace-relative paths under `hpc/<job_id>/featured/`). In this turn:

1. Call `attach_job(job_id).result()` to get the full result dict.
2. Inspect the outputs, run any analysis needed.
3. Call `write_artifact_file` to publish outputs worth keeping as artifacts.

```javascript
// In the analysis turn — read the full harvested result (non-blocking DB + directory scan)
const c = host.compute.create('ssh:<alias>')
const r = await c.attach_job(job_id).result()
// r → {
//   job_id, status, exit_code,
//   featured_files: ['hpc/<job_id>/featured/out.result', ...],   // workspace-relative
//   hidden_files:   ['hpc/<job_id>/hidden/run.log', ...],
//   output_files:   [...featured_files, ...hidden_files],         // featured first
//   left_on_remote: [{ uri: 'ssh:<alias>/<abs_path>', size_mb: 420, reason: 'residency:remote' }],
//   remote_workdir: '.openscience/jobs/<job_id>',
//   stdout_tail: '...last 64 KB...',
//   stderr_tail: '...last 64 KB...'
// }
```

Files land in the workspace at `hpc/<job_id>/` and are readable directly:

```python
# python cell — files are in the workspace; open() works with workspace-relative paths
import pandas as pd
df = pd.read_csv('hpc/<job_id>/featured/results.csv')
```

### Publish artifacts

Harvest only lands files in the workspace — it does NOT publish artifacts automatically.
Call `write_artifact_file` in the analysis turn to publish outputs worth keeping:

```javascript
// In the analysis turn — publish featured outputs as artifacts (bound to this turn)
for (const path of r.featured_files) {
  await host.mcp('artifacts', 'write_artifact_file', { path })
}
// Artifacts appear in the artifact panel with provenance tied to this analysis turn.
```

### When the job fails

Read `r.exit_code` and `r.stderr_tail`. An infrastructure failure (wrong partition, env not
activated, missing module, OOM, walltime) is yours to fix — adjust `command`, record the fix,
fresh `c.submit_job()`. A harvest failure (`r.stderr_tail` notes it, `r.remote_workdir` is
preserved) means some files were not downloaded — the remote workdir is kept so you can
`c.call_command('ls ...', intent='...')` to inspect what's there.

## Chaining jobs via left_on_remote

Large outputs declared with `residency: 'remote'` or files that exceed the size threshold stay
on the remote host and appear in `r.left_on_remote`. Use their URIs directly as `remote_path`
inputs to the next job — no local round-trip:

```javascript
// In the analysis turn — chain a left_on_remote output into the next job
const big_output_uri = r.left_on_remote[0].uri  // e.g. 'ssh:biowulf//scratch/jobs/<id>/big.h5'

const job2 = await c.submit_job(
  'process big.h5 output from job 1',
  'python process.py --input big.h5 --out summary.csv',
  {
    inputs: [
      { remote_path: big_output_uri }  // symlinked in job workdir, no transfer
    ],
    outputs: ['summary.csv']
  }
)
```

## Submitting several jobs

Submit a batch and let each job's analysis turn handle its results independently. The app
triggers a separate analysis turn for each job as it finishes (or merges simultaneous
completions into one turn with multiple job_ids):

```javascript
// Submit multiple jobs — end the cell after all submits
const c = host.compute.create('ssh:gpu-cluster')
const jobs = []
for (const seed of [0, 1, 2, 3, 4]) {
  const job = await c.submit_job(
    `AlphaFold seed ${seed}`,
    `python fold.py --seed ${seed} --in input.fasta --out ranked.pdb`,
    {
      inputs:  [{ src: 'input.fasta', dst_filename: 'input.fasta' }],
      outputs: [{ glob: '*.pdb', visibility: 'featured' }],
      timeout_seconds: 3600
    }
  )
  jobs.push(job.job_id)
}
print(jobs)   // end the cell — no waiting, no loop
```

The app triggers one analysis turn per job completion (or a merged turn for simultaneous
completions). **Do NOT write a loop collecting all results** — each analysis turn handles
its job independently.

## Session concurrency control

Cap how many non-terminal jobs run at once across all providers in this conversation. Jobs that
would exceed the cap enter a `queued` state and auto-dispatch when a slot frees up. These two
methods live on the handle returned by `create()`, but they are **session-scoped** — they act on
the whole conversation, not on the handle's bound provider.

```javascript
const c = host.compute.create('ssh:<alias>')

// Set the conversation-wide limit (positive integer 1..500).
await c.set_concurrency_limit(2)

// Read the session's concurrency status (non-blocking DB read, no SSH).
const s = await c.status()
// s → {
//   session_limit: number | null,            // the cap you set, or null if unset
//   active_count: number,                    // non-terminal jobs running now
//   queued_count: number,                    // jobs waiting for a slot
//   provider_ceilings: Record<string, number> // per-host hard limits (host config)
// }
```

## call_command error handling

```javascript
try {
  const r = await c.call_command('cmd', '<intent>')
} catch (e) {
  const code = e.error_code || ''
  if (code === 'host_unreachable') {
    // SSH connectivity issue — needs user action (VPN, key, etc.); e.retry_after_user_action is true
  } else if (code === 'approval_denied') {
    // User declined the approval card
  } else if (code === 'timeout') {
    // Command exceeded timeout_seconds
  }
}
```

## Typical first-contact workflow

1. `await host.compute.details(provider_id, { mode: 'read' })` — a `## Resources` skeleton means
   first contact; populated sections mean prior sessions did the legwork, trust them.
2. Bind once: `const c = host.compute.create(provider_id)`.
3. Run one batched probe: `await c.call_command('id; module avail 2>&1 | head -40', '<intent>')`.
4. Append what you learned via `await host.compute.details(..., { mode: 'append' })`.

## What to record in the knowledge doc

The knowledge doc is the only state that survives across sessions. Record:
- Scheduler type and any known partition/account combinations that worked.
- Environment activation commands (e.g. `module load X/<ver>`, `conda activate <env>`).
- Verified invocations tagged `verified <date>`; user-provided info tagged `per user <date>`.
- Gotchas specific to this host or provider.

Do NOT record per-job state, transient errors, or facts about your project — those belong
elsewhere. When a session ends without new host-specific learnings, write nothing.
