// host.agents.switch(nameOrNull) operation module (issue 05).
//
// This is the durable approved-switch operation for the trusted calling conversation.
// It resolves the target, requests the injected issue-02 approval gateway, and — on approval —
// persists the binding immediately and broadcasts a pending-reconfigure notification. The runtime
// The completion gate reconfigures at the outer control-tool boundary, so the Agent executing this
// SDK call can finish before the old prompt is stopped (design.md §9 / PRD §8).
//
// BOUNDARIES (design.md §9, cross-cutting requirements):
//  - Reuses the EXISTING SessionBindingService (in-memory binding) + the EXISTING durable
//    persistence seam + the EXISTING runtime reconfigure barrier + history replay. It does NOT
//    create a parallel switch service, a renderer-only durable binding, or a new approval broker.
//  - Real approval-broker composition is deferred to issue 08; tests wire a FAKE gateway.
//  - NEVER accepts a sandbox-supplied session id. The trusted calling-session identity is captured
//    outside the sandbox (issue 02) and injected as server context. Reserved routing/identity keys
//    are stripped by the dispatcher before this module runs; even if one survived it is ignored.
//  - Errors are sanitized and prefixed `host.agents.switch:`. Logs, summaries, and notifications
//    exclude system instructions, history text, tokens, and sensitive runtime configuration.
//  - Switch NEVER broadens to Main Agent on target or reconfigure failure (fail closed).
