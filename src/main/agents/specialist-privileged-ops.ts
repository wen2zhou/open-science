// Standalone privileged Specialist Profile operation: delete (issue 04).
//
// This module is the privileged-mutation branch of the conversational Specialist management flow.
// host.agents.update (including renames) is an ordinary chat-reviewed mutation handled by the issue
// 03 module; only DELETE passes through this approval-gated module (issue 04). It is deliberately
// standalone and independently testable: it consumes ONLY issue 02's ApprovalGateway contract and
// the existing ProfileService. It does NOT import issue 03 (ordinary mutation) or issue 05 (switch)
// implementation modules. Issue 08 composes it into the dispatcher.
//
// Design rules mirrored from design.md §8/§10 and the issue 04 acceptance criteria:
//  - Approval re-resolves the PUBLIC NAME to the UUID and verifies the REVIEWED REVISION immediately
//    before committing. Pre-card resolution is never mutation authority.
//  - A stale, renamed, deleted, or otherwise changed target after card creation FAILS CLOSED
//    without applying any part of the patch (sanitized `host.agents.<method>:` error).
//  - Delete verifies ABSENCE and returns `{ status: "deleted", name }` WITHOUT clearing or rewriting
//    session UUID bindings. Bound conversations resolve unavailable later (design.md §10).
//  - Decline returns a structured camelCase result such as `{ status: "declined", operation: "delete" }`
//    and produces NO mutation, invalidation, binding, runtime, or renderer state change.
//  - Catalog invalidation occurs ONLY after a successful mutation.
