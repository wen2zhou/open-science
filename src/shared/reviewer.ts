// v2 model (issue 12): the old Finding (warn/fail only) + ReviewCheck (pass/inconclusive, JSON blob
// on Review) are unified into a single ReviewCheck type stored in the Finding table. Every check —
// pass, warn, or fail — is now a first-class row. The Review row no longer carries a checks JSON
// column or a summary column; both are removed via migration.
//
// v3 model (issue 13): Review.reasoning is replaced by reviewerLog: ReviewerLogEntry[]. The reviewer
// session's actual action stream (thinking / tool calls / tool results / messages) is captured and
// stored, replacing the self-authored reasoning prose. submit_findings no longer accepts `reasoning`.

// One entry in the captured reviewer session action log.
// Streaming chunks (agent_thought_chunk, agent_message_chunk) are assembled into whole entries.
// tool entries carry the real tool name + input/output from the ACP session update stream.
// The old split tool_call / tool_result pair is collapsed into ONE unified tool entry per call:
// tool_call seeds the entry, tool_call_update(s) mutate it in place via shared object reference.
